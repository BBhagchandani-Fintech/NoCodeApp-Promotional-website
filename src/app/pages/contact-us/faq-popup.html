            What is OfficeBCP?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Ans: OfficeBCP stands for Office Business Continuity Plan. We are here to
          help you set up your office in the cloud so you can work from anywhere in the world.

            Why do I need OfficeBCP?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Ans: Setting up an office and infrastructure is expensive and it is not always possible to be physically
          present in the office. We will set up your office in such a way that you can then work from the office, beach,
          bar, coffee shop or anywhere you wish to work from.
